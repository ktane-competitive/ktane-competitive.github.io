	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>The Competitive KTaNE site provides a place to feature the solves on the <a href="https://bombs.samfun.dev/">Challenge Bomb Site</a> (CBS) for which a higher standard of proof, sufficient for a reliable competitive scene, is available. In particular, for these solves, there is video evidence of all players' perspectives for the duration of the solve.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In recognition of hardware requirements, and the hope that anyone wishing to participate in this site is able, video evidence does not need to be high quality or framerate; the aim is only that it is possible to tell what is happening in the video. Suggested minimum quality for this purpose is described on the <a href="rules.html">rules page</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The site also places slightly stronger restrictions on computational aids than the CBS, with the intention of preserving the feel of the gameplay of the original, vanilla game. The site's creators feel that strong computational aids and heavy scripting use is not compatible with vanilla-style gameplay, and should not be compared at anything close to a competitive level. A full description of these restrictions may be found on the <a href="rules.html">rules page</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<p>For the purpose of fair comparison, solves are separated out by the number of experts. Currently, the site lists solves with 0 (EFM/Solo), 1, 2 or 3 experts, since the vast majority of solves are done with these numbers of experts. However, this could be changed if there is sufficient demand for it.</p>
	
	<h2>Verification Standards</h2>
	<p>The site uses two levels of verification for the solves displayed:</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Preliminary</b> verification is a level of verification in line with the CBS, as well as checking that a solve-length video from each player exists. This guarantees that it is <i>possible</i> to check if the solve satisfies the site's rules.</p>
	<p><b>Full</b> verification is for solves where the video perspective of each player has been fully checked to satisfy the site's rules.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Due to the high workload that verification of video proof entails, full verification will likely be reserved for now to solves claiming top time on a mission for the number of experts on the team, as well as to those missions with a higher number of solves than others.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Solves that are found during any stage of verification not to adhere to the site's rules may be removed from the site. This does <i>not</i> have any effect on their standing outside of this site.</p>
